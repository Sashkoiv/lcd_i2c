lcd_i2c
----
This is just a simplified copy-paste from the project [python_lcd](https://github.com/dhylands/python_lcd) which is intended to be used with ESP32 (esp8266) modules.

The `ESP` boards itself doesn't have that much memory to be wasted and only necessary files should be copied there.
Also some renaming is done for the convenience.
